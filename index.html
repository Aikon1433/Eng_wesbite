        <h1>Safer Cycling in San Luis Obispo</h1>

        <p class="placeholder">
          Cycling, walking, and other forms of micromobility are central to how people move
          around San Luis Obispo and the Cal Poly campus. Students, faculty, and local residents
          use bikes, e-bikes, scooters, and walking routes every day to reach classes, housing,
          jobs, and downtown destinations. These modes are often faster than walking, more
          convenient than driving for short trips, and essential for people who do not own a car.
        </p>

        <p class="placeholder">
          However, many of the paths and streets they rely on were never designed for such a
          high volume of riders and pedestrians using the same space. Narrow painted bike lanes,
          shared routes, and crowded campus walkways regularly force people into close
          interaction, which can lead to near misses and serious collisions. Nationally, the
          United States sees far higher cycling fatality rates than countries like the Netherlands,
          Denmark, and Germany, where protected lanes and separated paths are standard.
        </p>

        <p class="placeholder">
          San Luis Obispo reflects these broader trends. In 2014, the city reported an unusually
          high rate of bicycle collisions for its size, and many more minor crashes and close calls
          likely go unreported. The purpose of this project is to show that improving bicycle
          infrastructure in SLO is not just a lifestyle choice—it is a matter of safety, equity, and
          accessibility for everyone who depends on affordable, sustainable transportation.

            <p class="placeholder">
              To prove that current conditions in SLO and on the Cal Poly campus are not safe for
              cyclists, and to offer practical, financially realistic steps toward a protected,
              predictable network that works better for everyone who walks, rides, or drives through
              the city.
