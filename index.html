        <h1>Safer Cycling in San Luis Obispo</h1>

        <p class="placeholder">
          Cycling, walking, and other forms of micromobility play an important role in how people
          travel throughout San Luis Obispo and the Cal Poly campus. Students, faculty, and
          residents depend on these modes every day to move between classes, housing, work, and
          leisure destinations across the city. As Cal Poly continues to grow, these forms of
          transportation have become even more central to campus life. Many students choose
          bicycles or other self propelled vehicles because they are faster than walking, more
          convenient than driving, and are better suited for short, frequent trips. At the same
          time, a large portion of the community chooses to walk, which creates a constant mix of
          pedestrians and riders going in the same direction. With so many people going the same
          direction, it is only natural that they will end up on the same paths which have not been
          designed to support such a high level of multimodal activity, oftentimes leading to
          dangerous situations and in some cases, collisions that can result in serious injury.

        <p class="placeholder">
          The conditions in San Luis Obispo reflect broader trends seen throughout the United
          States. Nationally, cycling safety outcomes are worse than in countries that have
          invested heavily in bicycle infrastructure. The United States averages 4.7 cycling deaths
          per 100 million trips, while the Netherlands averages 1.0, Denmark 1.1, and Germany 1.3.
          These countries have high ridership levels but far fewer fatalities because their streets
          are designed around protected lanes, separated paths, and predictable movement patterns
          that prevent collisions. In contrast, much of the infrastructure in the United States
          relies on painted bike lanes or shared routes that offer minimal physical protection. San
          Luis Obispo is no different, with many of its bike lanes positioned directly next to
          fast-moving traffic or within crowded pedestrian corridors.

        />

        <p class="placeholder">
          In 2014, San Luis Obispo reported 50.9 bicycle collisions per 1,000 bike commuters, a
          rate that is unusually high for a small city. Furthermore, many minor crashes and
          dangerous interactions go unreported, especially on campus, where riders often experience
          close calls or minor collisions but continue without reporting them to the proper
          authorities.
        </p>

        <p class="placeholder">
          The purpose of this project is to demonstrate that improving bicycle infrastructure in
          San Luis Obispo is not a matter of preference but a matter of safety, equity, and
          accessibility. By combining successful international design with local collision data and
          lived experiences, we aim to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that SLO is not safe for
          cyclists and provide policymakers a cost effective solution to make it so.

            <p class="placeholder">
              The website introduces the current conditions in SLO, analyzes survey data and
              collision patterns, and outlines infrastructure-based solutions that focus on safety
              rather than enforcement alone.

            <h3>Our Goal</h3>
            <p class="placeholder">
              Our goal is to present a clear, well-supported case for protected bike infrastructure
              on and around the Cal Poly campus, giving decision-makers a practical path toward a
              safer and more equitable transportation system.
