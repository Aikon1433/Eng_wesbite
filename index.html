        <h1>Safer Cycling in San Luis Obispo</h1>

        <p class="placeholder">
          Cycling, walking, and other forms of micromobility are central to how people move
          around San Luis Obispo and the Cal Poly campus. Students, faculty, and local residents
          use bikes, e-bikes, scooters, and walking routes every day to reach classes, housing,
          jobs, and downtown destinations. These modes are often faster than walking, more
          convenient than driving for short trips, and essential for people who do not own a car.
        </p>

        <p class="placeholder">
          However, many of the paths and streets they rely on were never designed for such a
          high volume of riders and pedestrians using the same space. Narrow painted bike lanes,
          shared routes, and crowded campus walkways regularly force people into close
          interaction, which can lead to near misses and serious collisions. Nationally, the
          United States sees far higher cycling fatality rates than countries like the Netherlands,
          Denmark, and Germany, where protected lanes and separated paths are standard.
        </p>

        <p class="placeholder">
          San Luis Obispo reflects these broader trends. In 2014, the city reported an unusually
          high rate of bicycle collisions for its size, and many more minor crashes and close calls
          likely go unreported. The purpose of this project is to show that improving bicycle
          infrastructure in SLO is not just a lifestyle choice—it is a matter of safety, equity, and
          accessibility for everyone who depends on affordable, sustainable transportation.

            <h3>Our Goal</h3>
            <p class="placeholder">
              To prove that current conditions in SLO and on the Cal Poly campus are not safe for
              cyclists, and to offer practical, financially realistic steps toward a protected,
              predictable network that works better for everyone who walks, rides, or drives through
              the city.

          While this site focuses on one university town, the patterns it describes can be seen in
          many other communities that are trying to balance growth, housing demand, and changing
          transportation habits. The choices cities make about bike lanes, parking, and campus
          design send a clear signal about whose safety and comfort matter most. By looking closely
          at San Luis Obispo and Cal Poly, we can see how small design details—like whether a lane
          is physically protected or where a crosswalk is placed—shape the daily experience of
          thousands of people. The argument of this project is that safer cycling is not a niche
          concern for hobby riders, but a basic part of creating a campus where students can move
          freely without needing a car.

          The website is organized so that readers can move from a broad overview into more detailed
          discussions of the problem and potential fixes. The main page introduces the stakes and
          explains why cycling deserves attention alongside other transportation priorities. The
          issue page then zooms in on current conditions in SLO, grounding the argument in survey
          responses and local data. The solutions page turns those findings into specific proposals,
          while the references page points visitors toward the research that supports each claim.
          Taken together, the site is meant to feel like both an accessible introduction for people
          new to the topic and a useful resource for decision makers who need concise, well-sourced
          evidence when considering new projects.
