        <h1>The Issue</h1>

        <h2>Issue Overview</h2>

        <p class="placeholder">
          The main issue facing cyclists and pedestrians in San Luis Obispo is that the current
          infrastructure does not reflect how people actually move through the city and around the
          Cal Poly campus. Major commuting routes such as Highland Drive, California Boulevard, and
          Monterey Street see large volumes of commuting cyclists every day, yet these streets
          depend heavily on narrow painted bike lanes, placing riders directly beside moving
          traffic and parked cars, which increases the risk of sudden merges, dooring, and
          visibility problems. Without physical barriers or consistent separation, cyclists must
          constantly navigate unpredictable situations, increasing the likelihood of collisions and
          near misses.
        </p>

          class="float-img-right"
        />

        <p class="placeholder">
          On campus, crowded conditions magnify these safety concerns. High-traffic areas around
          Kennedy Library, Dexter Lawn, the University Union, and campus entrances funnel cyclists
          and pedestrians into a limited number of spaces. Pathways often lack clear markings or
          defined zones, so riders and walkers are forced to navigate space in ways that feel
          chaotic during busy class change periods, which can lead to many near-misses or minor
          collisions.
        </p>

        <p class="placeholder">
          Conflicts between cyclists and motor vehicles also pose serious concerns. One third of
          surveyed cyclists reported experiencing a near miss with a vehicle in San Luis Obispo.
          These incidents occurred primarily on roads without bike lanes and at intersections or
          roundabouts, where riders are most exposed. In these locations, cyclists must compete for
          limited space with cars, which increases the risk of serious injury. Even in areas where
          bike lanes exist, limited separation and unclear markings leave cyclists uncertain about
          their position relative to traffic and motor vehicles, needing to hold precise lane
          position to avoid collision.
        </p>

        <h2>Social Justice &amp; Equity</h2>

        <img
          src="bike-race.jpg"
          alt="Cyclist riding along a path surrounded by trees."
          class="float-img-left"
        />

        <p class="placeholder">
          Beyond safety, the issue has a dimension of social justice. Bicycles are one of the most
          affordable and accessible methods of transportation available to students. With many
          students unable to afford the cost of a car, fuel, insurance, and parking permits, they
          depend heavily on bicycles to reach campus, jobs, and other intercity destinations. When
          bicycle infrastructure is inadequate or unsafe, lower income students face a
          disproportionate burden. They must navigate dangerous streets and crowded pathways not
          because they prefer to, but because they have limited alternatives.
        </p>

        <p class="placeholder">
          Pedestrians also experience inequities tied to infrastructure design. Sharing walkways
          with bicycles puts pedestrians at a higher risk for collision. Not to mention students
          with disabilities or limited mobility may face even greater challenges in these areas,
          since sudden interactions with cyclists can make navigation extremely dangerous.
        </p>

        <p class="placeholder">
          Overall, the findings show that the current infrastructure does not support the level of
          cycling and walking that defines daily movement in San Luis Obispo. Improving bicycle
          infrastructure would not only reduce collisions but also create a more equitable
          transportation environment. A network built on protected lanes, clear signage, and
          predictable crossings would provide safer travel for everyone while supporting the
          students and community members who rely on affordable and sustainable transportation
          (Pucher &amp; Buehler, 2016; Krizec, 2007).
        </p>

        <h2>Analysis of the Issue</h2>

        <p class="placeholder">
          The San Luis Obispo (SLO) region is quite active and as a result sees high volume of
          bicycle traffic, especially in the case of students at the Cal Poly university located on
          its northern outskirts. Despite having many riders, the SLO region lacks widespread
          adoption of dedicated bike infrastructure. The current installations include painted bike
          lanes along roads and bike racks for storage. There are very few bike lanes with full
          separation from pedestrian or vehicular traffic (Class I bike lane), which can lead to
          many dangerous situations (Pucher &amp; Buehler, 2016).
        </p>

        <h2>Survey and Results</h2>

        <p class="placeholder">
          In a questionnaire we conducted, 80% of all cyclists reported having one or more near
          collisions with pedestrians in the past 12 months and 60% of all pedestrians report
          near-miss incidents with bicycles. However, looking at crash reports for the district,
          these numbers seem quite high, as police reported crashes 50.9 per every 1,000 residents,
          or just 5 percent (Bike Crash Mapper, n.d.). While the two statistics aren’t directly
          comparable—crashes versus near misses—they provide insight into the number of instances
          that go unreported to the policymakers and civil engineers tasked with creating new bike
          infrastructure (Medury et al., 2019).

            <h3>Near Miss Collisions with Motor Vehicles</h3>
            <p class="placeholder">
              One third of surveyed cyclists reported experiencing a near miss with a motor
              vehicle, most often on streets without bike lanes and at intersections or roundabouts
              (Medury et al., 2019).

            <h3>Near Miss Collisions with Bicycles</h3>
            <p class="placeholder">
              For pedestrians, 60% reported at least one near-miss collision with a bicycle while
              walking in San Luis Obispo, highlighting that people on foot also carry a significant
              share of the risk (Medury et al., 2019).

        </div>

        <p class="placeholder">
          In the survey, pedestrians believed that more painted bike lanes and stricter enforcement
          of bicycle-related traffic laws would remedy the number of dangerous situations they
          face. Cyclists offered a different perspective, favoring the creation of a bicycle
          highway system—a connected network of Class I bicycle lanes—to protect them from motor
          vehicles, along with railings and other separation features around existing bike lanes on
          campus (Pucher &amp; Buehler, 2016).
        </p>

        <p class="placeholder">
          A study conducted by the American Public Health Association affirms the cyclists’ view,
          stating that the reason for the low crash rate of cyclists in developed European nations
          is the presence of “on-road bicycle lanes and off-road bicycle paths, often including
          priority traffic signals and advance stop lines for cyclists at intersections” (Pucher &amp;
          Buehler, 2016).

            <p class="placeholder">
              Examining pedestrians’ suggestions—stricter law enforcement and more painted bike
              lanes—studies have found these approaches less effective and not worth the manpower
              required (International Police Mountain Bike Association, n.d.).

            <h3>Cost of Enforcement vs. Infrastructure</h3>
            <p class="placeholder">
              Interviews with law enforcement agencies by the International Police Mountain Bike
              Association note that hiring and training new officers to focus on bicycle laws would
              likely cost hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of dollars each year, whereas
              infrastructure is a one-time investment (International Police Mountain Bike
              Association, n.d.).
            </p>

        </div>

        <p class="placeholder">
          To hire even five police officers on a rotating schedule would require upwards of
          $300,000 per year, excluding the cost of new training programs, instructor pay,
          facilities, and equipment (ZipRecruiter, n.d.). Because enforcement is an annually
          renewing expense while infrastructure is a long-term asset, the remainder of this project
          focuses on the creation of better bicycle facilities rather than expanding enforcement
          (Krizec, 2007; Pucher &amp; Buehler, 2016).
