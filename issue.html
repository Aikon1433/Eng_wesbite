        <h1>The Issue</h1>

        <h2>Infrastructure That Doesn’t Match How People Move</h2>
        <p class="placeholder">
          The main issue facing cyclists and pedestrians in San Luis Obispo is that the transportation
          network does not reflect how people actually travel through the city and across the Cal Poly
          campus. Major commuting streets like Highland Drive, California Boulevard, and Monterey
          Street carry large volumes of riders every day, yet they rely heavily on narrow painted bike
          lanes right next to moving traffic and parked cars. This increases the risk of sudden merges,
          dooring, and visibility problems, especially where there is no physical separation from cars.
        </p>

        <p class="placeholder">
          On campus, these problems are magnified. Areas around Kennedy Library, Dexter Lawn, the
          University Union, and main campus entrances funnel huge numbers of riders and pedestrians
          into a few shared spaces. Paths often lack clear markings or defined zones, so during class
          changes the movement can feel chaotic, with frequent near misses and occasional collisions
          between people walking and cycling.
        </p>

        <h2>What Our Survey and Data Show</h2>
        <p class="placeholder">
          In a recent questionnaire, 80% of cyclists reported at least one near collision with a pedestrian
          in the past year, and 60% of pedestrians reported near-miss incidents with bikes. Official
          police crash reports tell a different story, with far fewer incidents recorded. The gap between
          lived experience and reported crashes suggests that many dangerous events are invisible to
          policymakers and engineers, even though they strongly affect how safe people feel using
          these routes.
        </p>

        <h2>Social Justice &amp; Equity</h2>
        <p class="placeholder">
          Bicycles are one of the most affordable and accessible forms of transportation available to
          students. Many cannot afford a car, fuel, insurance, and parking, so they rely on bikes to get
          to campus, work, and daily necessities. When bike routes are unsafe or confusing, lower-income
          riders bear a disproportionate burden: they must navigate dangerous streets not by choice,
          but because they have limited alternatives.
        </p>

        <p class="placeholder">
          Pedestrians experience similar inequities. Sharing walkways with fast-moving bikes raises the
          risk of collisions for everyone, and students with disabilities or limited mobility face even
          greater hazards when they have to anticipate sudden interactions with cyclists. Safer,
          separated spaces are essential for an inclusive campus environment.
        </p>

        <h2>Why Change Is Necessary</h2>
        <p class="placeholder">
          Overall, the current network does not support the level of cycling and walking that defines
          daily movement in SLO. Improving bicycle infrastructure would reduce collisions and near
          misses, while also creating a more equitable transportation system. A network built on
          protected lanes, clear signage, and predictable crossings would provide safer travel for
          everyone and better support people who rely on affordable, sustainable transportation.
        </p>

        <p class="placeholder">
          For many students and residents, these problems are not abstract statistics but part of
          everyday life. People describe planning their routes around the times when paths feel
          least crowded, or riding on sidewalks even when they know it is discouraged because the
          travel lanes on certain streets feel too fast and too close. Others avoid biking at night
          altogether because lighting is inconsistent and drivers may not expect cyclists on the
          road. When enough people start making these kinds of risk calculations, the message is
          clear: the system is not working for the people who rely most on active transportation.
          Documenting these experiences is an important part of showing that change is needed and
          that the current level of risk is not inevitable.
        </p>

        <p class="placeholder">
          Another important aspect of the issue is how unfamiliar many people are with the design
          vocabulary used in bike planning. Terms like Class I, Class II, or buffered lanes can feel
          technical, but they describe real differences in comfort and safety. A narrow stripe of
          paint on a busy road places nearly all of the responsibility on the rider to stay alert and
          hold a perfect line, while a protected path shares that responsibility with the built
          environment. When students learn what these designs mean, they are better equipped to
          notice where infrastructure falls short and to ask for improvements in specific, concrete
          ways. This project tries to bridge that gap by explaining not only that current conditions
          are unsafe, but also how different design choices could make the same streets feel very
          different.
