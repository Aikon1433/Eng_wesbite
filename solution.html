        <h1>Proposed Solutions</h1>

        <h2>Creation of Infrastructure</h2>
        <p class="placeholder">
          In order to identify the correct type of safety measure for each location, we turned to
          the Californian Highway Design Manual. To warrant a Class I bike lane, it is recommended
          that these facilities be used in areas frequented by high-speed commuters or where
          interactions with vehicles or pedestrians should be minimized (California Department of
          Transportation, 2020). Among the listed examples of such areas are school campuses.
          Currently, within Cal Poly’s borders only Class II bikeways and shared roadways can be
          found, with no cycling infrastructure providing full separation.
        </p>

        <p class="placeholder">
          Looking at locations on campus that receive heavy traffic, there are several that would
          benefit from the creation of a Class I bike lane. Locations such as the promenade along
          Building 1901 and areas around the Kennedy Library see high volumes of pedestrian and
          cyclist traffic, yet have few measures to protect against collisions and were cited as
          some of the most dangerous in the survey (Medury et al., 2019).
        </p>

        />

        <h2>Cost of Creation</h2>
        <p class="placeholder">
          The cost of creating such a bike lane can be estimated by comparing the needed length to
          cost estimates created by Portland State University. The study looks at labor and
          material costs near and around the university to provide its estimates, meaning it will
          not be perfect. In fact, the average hourly wage of a construction worker in San Luis
          Obispo is $49, whereas in Portland it is $27, meaning estimates need an 81% adjustment
          for higher labor costs (ZipRecruiter, n.d.; Dill, 2013).
        </p>

        <p class="placeholder">
          Per foot, the cost of a two-way raised “cycling track” (Class I bikeway) is $188
          according to Portland-based estimates (Dill, 2013). Applying the 81% increase for labour
          shows that it would cost approximately $340 per foot of Class I bikeway constructed in
          San Luis Obispo County. To rebuild a 500-foot section along the promenade, it would cost
          an estimated $170,000, including demolition and construction.
        </p>

        <p class="placeholder">
          While this may seem like a large number to an individual, for an institution like Cal
          Poly or the County of San Luis Obispo it is a reasonable amount for an infrastructure
          overhaul—less than one-fiftieth of a percent of the university’s annual budget (Cal Poly
          Budget Office, 2024). In the 2023–2024 season, Transportation and Parking Services made
          $949,000 after operating and maintenance expenditures. Being responsible for transit and
          safety on campus, this department could use a portion of that surplus to build an
          estimated 2,800 feet—about half a mile—of bike lanes on campus to enhance safety (Cal
          Poly Budget Office, 2024).

          class="inline-img"
        />

        <h2>Commuter Safety</h2>
        <p class="placeholder">
          For commuters riding to and from campus, the challenge is even greater because there are
          many different routes that people take. A satellite view of the region shows that the
          majority of the town’s population, including students, lives in an area stretching from
          the southeast to the west when centered on campus. Major thoroughfares in these areas
          lack safe bike lanes; many provide only Class II lanes and some are shared routes (Bike
          Crash Mapper, n.d.).
        </p>

        <p class="placeholder">
          To provide better safety along these routes, Class I bike lanes would both meet the
          state’s recommendations in the Highway Design Manual and see enough use to justify the
          cost (California Department of Transportation, 2020). A partial example exists on Chorro
          Street, where a Class I bike lane runs almost the entire length from its intersection
          with Foothill Boulevard to downtown. Using the same cost estimates as for the campus
          bikeway, covering each major commuter street with a mile of Class I infrastructure would
          cost about $5.4 million in taxpayer dollars (Dill, 2013).
        </p>

        <p class="placeholder">
          With such a large price tag, implementation would likely need to occur in stages,
          starting with the most dangerous sections according to existing crash and near-miss
          reports (Medury et al., 2019). This phased approach would allow the city and university
          to prioritize areas where improvements would have the greatest impact on safety.
        </p>

        <h2>Increasing Visibility of Crashes</h2>
        <p class="placeholder">
          Recent research points to concrete ways universities and cities can collect better data on
          bicycle incidents when deciding where to create more bike infrastructure. One promising
          approach is to bypass police reports altogether, letting people who walk and bike record
          incidents directly. Aditya Medury and colleagues tested this idea around several
          university campuses using a crowdsourcing platform where users logged crashes and
          near-misses on a map (Medury et al., 2019).
        </p>

        <p class="placeholder">
          Their study showed that this method captured many incidents that never appeared in
          official police statistics, especially minor collisions and falls that still indicate
          dangerous locations (Medury et al., 2019). A system like this at Cal Poly—whether as a
          campus web form or mobile app—could quickly reveal “hotspots” where students regularly
          experience conflicts, giving engineers and planners the insight they need to make
          informed decisions on where to build new infrastructure first.
