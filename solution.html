        <h1>Proposed Solutions</h1>

        <p class="placeholder">
          This proposal focuses on building safer places to ride rather than simply enforcing bicycle
          laws more aggressively. Expanding enforcement would be expensive and difficult to sustain,
          requiring new training, additional officers, and ongoing annual costs. By contrast, well-designed
          infrastructure is a one-time investment that can protect riders and pedestrians for years with
          relatively low maintenance.

            <h3>1. Build Protected Class I Bikeways on Campus</h3>
            <p class="placeholder">
              Using the California Highway Design Manual as a guide, we recommend constructing
              Class I bikeways in locations where interactions with vehicles and pedestrians should be
              minimized—exactly the conditions found on parts of the Cal Poly campus. High-traffic
              areas like the main promenade and the surroundings of Kennedy Library see dense flows of
              both walkers and riders, yet currently offer little physical separation or protection. A
              protected, two-way bikeway would organize movement and reduce conflicts in these
              hotspots.
            </p>

          <div class="card">
            <h3>2. Invest in a Promenade Pilot Segment</h3>
            <p class="placeholder">
              As a concrete first step, the project proposes rebuilding a roughly 500-foot section of the
              campus promenade as a raised, protected cycling track. Based on cost estimates from
              similar projects adjusted for local labor rates, this segment would cost about $170,000 to
              construct. For a university the size of Cal Poly, this is a relatively small share of the overall
              budget but could dramatically improve safety along one of the most heavily used corridors.

          <div class="card">
            <h3>3. Extend a Safe Commuter Network</h3>
            <p class="placeholder">
              Beyond campus borders, many students live in neighborhoods to the south, east, and west,
              traveling along major streets that currently lack safe, separated bike facilities. Over time,
              the city and campus should build Class I bikeways on key commuter routes—such as
              Foothill, California, and Monterey—starting with the most dangerous segments identified
              in crash and near-miss data. The long-term vision is a connected “bicycle highway”
              system that links neighborhoods directly to campus and downtown.

          <div class="card">
            <h3>4. Create a Crash &amp; Near-Miss Reporting System</h3>
            <p class="placeholder">
              To decide where to invest first, Cal Poly and the city should implement a simple, online
              reporting tool that lets people log crashes and near misses on a map. Research around
              other university campuses shows that crowdsourced reporting captures many incidents that
              never appear in police statistics, especially minor collisions and falls that still signal
              dangerous locations. A campus-focused map or app would highlight “hotspots” and guide
              phased construction of new facilities.

          <div class="card">
            <h3>5. Treat Bike Infrastructure as a Long-Term Investment</h3>
            <p class="placeholder">
              Economic studies of bicycle facilities consistently find that the benefits of safer cycling
              infrastructure outweigh the costs, especially in places that have not yet invested heavily in
              bike networks. Benefits include improved mobility, increased physical activity, health-care
              savings, fewer crashes, reduced congestion and pollution, and better neighborhood
              livability. Even modest projects, like a $170,000 protected path, can pay off over time when
              these wider impacts are considered.  
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p class="placeholder">
          None of these recommendations are meant to be one-size-fits-all answers. Instead, they
          show a range of tools that campus planners and city officials can combine as funding,
          politics, and space allow. A successful strategy will likely involve testing smaller pilot
          projects, collecting feedback, and adjusting the design before committing to larger
          corridors. It will also require clear communication with drivers, pedestrians, and riders
          so that new facilities feel intuitive rather than confusing. When people understand why a
          lane was added, how they are expected to use it, and where it connects, they are more
          likely to support future investments and advocate for continued improvements.
        </p>

        <p class="placeholder">
          Implementing these ideas will also require collaboration beyond the campus. Regional
          transit agencies, neighborhood groups, and local businesses all have a role to play in
          shaping safer routes. For example, a shop owner who understands that a protected lane can
          bring more people past their storefront may become an advocate rather than an opponent of
          reallocating street space. Likewise, student organizations can help gather feedback,
          organize ride audits, or host outreach events that introduce new riders to the upgraded
          network. In this way, physical changes on the ground are paired with cultural changes that
          normalize cycling as a safe, everyday option for getting around.
