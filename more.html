        <h1>Conclusions &amp; Further Research</h1>

        <p class="placeholder">
          Although our findings show that rebuilding the most dangerous segment of campus as a
          Class I bikeway could cost approximately $170,000—a relatively small price—the fact that
          this investment has not yet been made raises a larger question: what are policymakers
          missing? In official data, most crashes go unreported as the people affected often think
          filing a report is not worth the hassle, if they think of it at all (Medury et al.,
          2019). Campus-based research using crowdsourced surveys has found that the majority of
          pedestrian and bicycle crashes around universities never make it into police reports,
          especially when injuries are minor or there is little property damage (Medury et al.,
          2019).
        </p>

        <p class="placeholder">
          Riders often decide it is “not worth the hassle” to call the police for a fall, a
          low-speed crash with another bike, or a collision with a friend. Others may worry about
          getting themselves in trouble if they were riding without lights, breaking a traffic
          rule, or using campus spaces in technically “wrong” ways, so they simply walk it off
          instead of making a formal report. Many incidents also happen on paths, parking lots, and
          other campus property where no officer ever shows up, so there is no automatic record at
          all (Medury et al., 2019). By reporting even minor crashes, however, lawmakers and city
          planners can gain the visibility they need to develop solutions and prevent more serious
          crashes in the future.
        </p>

        <p class="placeholder">
          Non-motorized travel is usually measured poorly, with walking and cycling lumped together
          and treated as a side note to vehicular traffic. As one review of bicycle research puts
          it, the “black cloud looming over all analysis of non-motorized transportation” is the
          lack of good data and the tendency to treat cycling as marginal (Pucher &amp; Buehler,
          2016). When near-misses and “small” crashes disappear into this data gap, it creates a
          false sense of safety. Only a handful of official crashes are considered by policymakers
          who may conclude that the system works fine, while students deal with daily close calls
          and minor crashes that go unreported and unsolved (Medury et al., 2019).
        </p>

        <p class="placeholder">
          Research on bike facilities suggests that projects like a separated path near Cal Poly
          should be seen less as a one-time expense and more as a long-term public investment.
          Kevin J. Krizec’s review of economic studies on bicycling facilities shows that, in the
          small number of cases where full benefit–cost ratios have been calculated, benefits
          consistently exceed costs—often by several multiples—especially in places that have not
          yet invested heavily in cycling infrastructure (Krizec, 2007). This pattern appears in
          very different contexts, from European and Latin American cities to Norwegian towns
          building walking and cycling networks, suggesting that the basic economic logic of bike
          investments is robust across regions (Krizec, 2007).
        </p>

        <p class="placeholder">
          Krizec also notes that the benefits of bike infrastructure are not limited to faster or
          more convenient trips. He points to a broad set of gains, including improved mobility,
          increased physical activity, health-care savings, enhanced cyclist safety, reduced
          congestion and pollution, and overall improvements in neighborhood livability (Krizec,
          2007). The health aspect alone is striking: across the studies he reviewed, estimated
          annual health-care cost savings from physical activity range from around $19 to $1,175
          per person, with a median of $128 per person per year (Krizec, 2007). If a protected
          campus route encouraged even a few hundred students to bicycle regularly, the long-term
          health savings, combined with avoided crash costs and other benefits, would make a
          $170,000 path look small when spread across its lifetime.
        </p>

        <p class="placeholder">
          The next steps are clear. Cal Poly and city partners should create a simple reporting
          system for crashes and near misses near campus. A web map or app would allow riders and
          pedestrians to flag hotspots in real time (Medury et al., 2019). Engineers would gain a
          sharper view of problem areas instead of relying on sparse police records. This
          information should guide staged construction of a protected network. The first priority
          should focus on campus entrances and the promenade segment already highlighted in this
          proposal, with later phases extending protection along major commuter streets such as
          Foothill, California, and Monterey (California Department of Transportation, 2020).
        </p>

        <p class="placeholder">
          Investments in safe cycling infrastructure are not a luxury. Students who depend on bikes,
          e-bikes, scooters, and other small forms of transportation need safer routes that reduce
          the risk of injury and make it easier to reach classes and jobs. Clear separation and
          predictable movements keep stress and conflict to a minimum for pedestrians as well. The
          broader community will see fewer car trips and fewer crashes, easing pressure on streets,
          budgets, and emergency services (Pucher &amp; Buehler, 2016; Krizec, 2007). An investment
          of approximately $170,000 in protected segments on campus and city routes would move SLO
          toward a safer, more equitable, and healthier future.

          These references are a starting point rather than a complete library. Future work could
          build on them by gathering new survey data, mapping additional crash locations, or
          comparing SLO to other college towns that have invested more heavily in cycling
          infrastructure. By combining local knowledge with studies like the ones listed here,
          students and community members can keep pushing for changes that make everyday travel
          safer and more sustainable (Krizec, 2007; Pucher &amp; Buehler, 2016).
